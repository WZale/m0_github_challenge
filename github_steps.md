# GitHub Steps

In order to establish a connection between a local and remote repo on Github, you should clone the remote repo from GitHub onto your machine using the 'git clone' command, followed by the SSH key. This will allow you to push changes back up to your own copy of the repo.

You won't need to complete an initial commit, given that you cloned an existing repo that already has one. Therefore, your first commit should only reference changes that you have made.
